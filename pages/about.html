        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>
          Our founder and CEO, Bryon McLendon, turned down a lucrative career
          opportunity to pursue his passion of helping others live a fit, happy
          and healthy lifestyle. Unemployed yet determined, he drained his bank
          account and opened his first retail nutrition store in 1997. With
          laser-sharp focus, he went to work every single day, morning to night.
          His wife, Tania, a personal trainer and former college track athlete,
          was his rock, encouraging him along the way. Within two years, Bryon
          had opened five locations.
        </p>
        <p>
          After gaining several years of knowledge and expertise in the
          industry, Bryon decided to start his very own company, thus
          NUTRISHOP®, Inc. was born with the first store opening in Norco,
          California in 2003. Bryon extended the opportunity to other
          like-minded, hard-working entrepreneurs who were passionate about
          helping others. Founded on the pillars of honesty, integrity, trust,
          opportunity and good ol’ fashioned hard work, our NUTRISHOP® family
          grew.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 22px">
          "We have store owners who hated their jobs and now they're able to do
          something they love while changing lives for the better and providing
          for their families," says Bryon. "That gets me excited!"
        </p>

        <p>
          In 2008, Bryon’s wife Tania left her personal training career to help
          fill in the gaps of the NUTRISHOP® corporate team. She did everything
          from accounting to operations. Today, she’s involved with the rep team
          and franchisees directly to help educate them and their employees
          through the recently launched NUTRISHOP® University program.
        </p>
        <p>
          At NUTRISHOP®, we consider family to be an integral part of the
          business. Bryon’s father, Jerry, sold his share of a successful
          graphic design company to bring his decades of expertise to
          NUTRISHOP®. Bryon’s talented younger brother, Marc, runs and oversees
          the graphic design and marketing team. Bryon’s younger sister, Lacey,
          supports our COO Brian Barthelmess, and Bryon’s youngest sister,
          Kellie, recently came on board as the in-house photographer and
          videographer for the marketing department.
        </p>

        <p>
          We also consider our store owners and their staff an extension of our
          family. We strive to support them in every way possible so they can
          provide for their families while offering invaluable services to
          customers across the United States and internationally.
        </p>

        <h1>19+ Years of Consumer Trust</h1>

        <p>
          Serving fit-minded individuals since 2003, NUTRISHOP®’s top priority
          is your results. This has ultimately helped build our solid reputation
          over the last 19+ years and keeps customers coming back to this day.
          We respect our customers. We would never waste your time with a poor
          product, poor service or poor support. We can all agree that honesty
          must extend to product performance attributes. Rest assured that all
          of these top-quality supplement brands are manufactured here in the
          USA, under strict cGMP manufacturing practices, utilizing superior,
          worldwide ingredients. Thank you for your trust and patronage!
        </p>

        <h1>
          We are not your average retail nutrition company pushing unnecessary
          products on people just to make a buck. What is Nutrishop all about?
        </h1>

        <h1>It’s About You</h1>
        <p>
          If you asked any NUTRISHOP® owner or employee what sets us apart from
          our competitors other than our guaranteed low prices, hands down you’d
          hear the difference is the relationships we build with our customers.
        </p>
        <p>
          When someone comes into our stores, their goals immediately become
          ours. Our in-store experience is very consultative, unique and custom
          to everyone. There is not one plan, one supplement, or one supplement
          stack to fit all individuals and their needs. We take the time to
          educate you and make sure you are as confident in your nutrition
          program as we are.
        </p>

        <p>
          Plus, it just feels good getting to know our customers and helping
          them achieve their goals! Take it from Jay Vicino, owner of the Mt.
          Juliet, Tennessee NUTRISHOP® store: “The most gratifying thing for me
          as a store owner is being the driving force in somebody changing their
          life for the better,” says Jay. “I’ll gladly spend 2 hours with
          someone if they genuinely need the help!”
        </p>

        <h1>It’s About Quality Products & Services</h1>
        <p>
          Whether you’re looking for a thermogenic, a potent pre-workout, a
          delicious protein powder, healthy vitamins, BCAAs, or something else,
          we’ve got you covered. With plenty of products to choose from, the
          only problem you may have is deciding which ones to get!
        </p>

        <p>
          In addition to top-quality nutritional supplements, our stores offer
          complimentary composition assessment tools, meal plans and vital
          nutritional support/guidance that you can’t get online. Our store
          owners also conduct transformation challenges in-store or for
          corporate wellness programs in their communities. Read more about our
          services here.
        </p>

        <h1>It’s About Real Results</h1>
        <p>
          We’ve lost count of how many of our customers have experienced
          life-changing results over the years. This is what drives us to do
          what we do! Take Danae Peirce, a customer at the NUTRISHOP® in Lacey,
          WA, who lost 40 pounds, gained lean muscle and changed the overall
          appearance of her body thanks to store owner/nutrition consultant Amy
          Jo Palmquest.
        </p>

        <p>
          “My weight-loss transformation has significantly changed my life,”
          says Danae. “Not only do I feel stronger, healthier and have more
          energy to enjoy activities with my husband and two young daughters,
          but I have also gained an unexpected amount of confidence.”
        </p>

        <p>
          Typically shy and reserved, this confidence led Danae to opportunities
          she would have never imagined herself taking. She was featured in a
          magazine, she did a fitness photo shoot, and she spoke at a women’s
          fitness camp. “The most exciting part, my transformation has also
          inspired others,” she says. “Family members, friends, and
          acquaintances have reached out to ask questions or have started their
          own personal health transformations.”
